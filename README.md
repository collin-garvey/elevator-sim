# Elevator Simulator

Work in progress!

I ride an elevator almost every day. Over the years, I've noticed that some elevators have different logic depending on the size of the building and how many cars are in operation. This is my attempt to distill and replicate the logic of a simple elevator and how they respond to an unpredictable amount of passengers throughout a given day.

## Feature Roadmap

- Dynamically generate passengers on floors based on results returned from some unrelated external API (perhaps a twitter hashtag)
- Build adapters for different elevator algorithms
- Build performance measuring between algorithms to determine simulated efficiency of different elevator algorithms.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
